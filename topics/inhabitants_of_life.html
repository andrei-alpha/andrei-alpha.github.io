                <p><b>Still lives</b> – These patterns are distinguishable by a simple feature – they remain the same from one generation to another. In a sense they are oscillators with period 1. Small still lives, such as the block, often occur naturally in the evolution of a random pattern, and form the main part of what remains after changes “die out”.</p> 
                
                <p>Finding new, ever more elaborate still lives can be an interesting puzzle, undertaken by many enthusiasts, starting from Life’s creator, John Conway, who computed all possible still lives between 4 and 7 cells. With the advent of increasingly powerful personal computers, it became possible to do exhaustive searches in larger spaces. For example, Mark Niemiec created a list of all possible still lives between 15 and 24 cells.</p>
                
                <p>What are still lives good for, other than sitting there and looking pretty? A special subcategory, the eaters, has a crucial role in creating logic circuits, by absorbing gliders and other objects. For more on this subject, see the Constructs section. </p>

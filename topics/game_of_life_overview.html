                <h1>Introduction - About Conway and the appearance of Game of Life</h1>

                <p>Perhaps the most renowned cellular automaton which escaped the restrained world of complicated mathematical and computational patterns and reached hearts of a wider public is Game of Life. This was developed by John Horton Conway, mathematician at Gonville and Caius College in the University of Cambridge. Aside from his important contribution to fields such as group theory and number theory, much of Conway's time was dedicated to recreational mathematics. Despite his prolific activity, though, the academic used to rarely publish his discoveries.</p>
            
                <p>Inspired by von Neumann's effort to devise a self-replicating machine, Conway sought to simplify the complicated rules the Hungarian-American mathematician used for describing the evolution of such a system. In October 1970,  Martin Gardner presented "Conway's latest brainchild" in the popular Scientific American magazine, thus marking the game's first public appearance.</p>

                <td><h1>What is Game of Life?</h1>
            
                <p>The game is made out of an infinite two-dimensional grid of square cells, which can be found in two states - either alive or dead. The state of each cell is solely influenced by its 8 neighbours (4 orthogonally adjacent, 4 diagonally adjacent). Surprisingly simple rules shape the behaviour of cells at the end of a stage as follows:
                </td></tr></table>
                
                <li>A cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours <b>survives</b>;</li> 
                <li>A cell with less than 2 live neighbours <b>dies</b>, as if by isolation. Conversely, a cell with more than 3 live neighbours also <b>dies</b>, as if by overcrowding.</li>
                <li>A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes <b>alive</b>, as if by reproduction.</li><p>
                
                <p><i>Game of Life is a so called zero-player game. The initial state of the grid is the only input which is required for the game to run. After knowing its configuration, the game will self-generate and the player will be able to observe its evolution after each stage.</i></p>
            
                <p>A key aspect in understanding the concept behind the game is to realize that all the transitions occur simultaneously. For this reason, it raised quite a challenge to people who preferred to play it without the aid of a computer. This is because one must take additional care such that newborn cells resulting from a stage would not be mistakenly placed in the configuration of the stage from which they emerged, potentially generating erroneous births or deaths. Fortunately enough, a new generation of affordable computers was just being launched on the market when the game appeared. They helped grow its popularity and made it more interesting, since they allowed an easier spotting of patterns which may arise from various initial configurations.</p>
            
                <p>The simple rules for birth, deaths and survival of cells were chosen very carefully, after thorough experimentation. To make the game as unpredictable as possible, Conway decided that ideally, there should be no patterns which are easily proven to grow explosively and / or infinitely. On the other hand, he also stated that there should be patterns which apparently grow without limit, but in reality have a chaotic behaviour. Perhaps the most important concern of Conway was regarding simplicity - he wished that relatively trivial initial configurations would grow and shrink to different sizes and end up either fading away, oscillating between two or more states or reaching a stable, final state.</p>

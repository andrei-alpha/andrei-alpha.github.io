<center><h2>Problem Hotel</h2></center>

<p>Hotel "Computing" is one of the most luxurious hotels in South Ken.
Throughout the year several groups of tourists arrive at the hotel or
leave at the end of their stay. Thus, the exact situation of free rooms
occupied is quite difficult to know, especially as the hotel has a
large number of rooms. However, this year Tony, the hotel owner, decided that he
needed a change. That is why he hired you to write an effective program
that responds to its needs.
  
<h3>Requirement</h3>
Write a program to efficiently treat these three types of instructions:
<br></br>
<b>Type 1:</b> the arrival of a new group of tourists:
A group is composed of M members that want to occupy M free
consecutively numbered rooms. The program will receive the beginning of the
sequence of rooms occupied by the group and the number M of group members.
You are guaranteed that any of the rooms i, i +1, ..., i + M-1 is free at the time.
<br></br>
<b>Type 2:</b> a group of departing tourists:
When they leave, tourists go in groups (not necessarily the same as the ones in
wich they have came). When a group of M members leaves, it make available M rooms
(previously occupied) numbered consecutively. The program will receive the
beginning of the sequence of rooms emptied and number M of group members. It is
guaranteed that all rooms from i to i + M -1 are occupied by tourists.
<br></br>
<b>Type 3:</b> owner question:
Tony can ask from time to time, which is the maximum length of a
sequence of free rooms numbered consecutively. He needs this number
to know the maximum possible members of a group that could be accommodated
at the hotel "Computing".

<h3>Input</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>
<p>
The first line will contain numbers N and P, representing the number
of hotel rooms (numbered from 1 to N) and the number of instructions
that follow. On each of the next P lines there will be a number c,
representing the type of the instruction:

<li>if c has the value 1, then it will be followed by two other numbers,
i and M, representing the number of the first room to be occupied by the group
that has just arrived and the number of group members</li>
<li>if c has the value 2, then it will be followed by other two numbers,
i and M, representing the number of the first room that will be released
by the leaving group and the number of group members</li>
<li>if c has the value 3, it is not followed by any other number on
that line. However, the program has to write to the output the
maximum length of a sequence of free rooms numbered consecutively.</li>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<li>3 &le; <i>N</i> &le; 100 000 </li>
<li>3 &le; <i>P</i> &le; 200 000 </li>
<li>In any room can be accommodated at one time a single tourist.</li>

<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>You have to display, for each instruction of type 3,
on one spearate line, the maximum length of a sequence of free rooms
numbered consecutively, taking into account all the instructions of type
1 and 2 in the input before this instruction to the answer.
Before the first instruction, all rooms are free.
